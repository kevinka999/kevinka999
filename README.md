## Want to know a little about me?
My name is Kevin Katzer and I'm a Fullstack Web Developer from Brazil! My primary stack is React.js and .NET, everything depends on the moon phase (just kidding). I'm a frontend lover! so I think you can guess what moon phase is most commom here LOL. Away from the computer, I like to practice sports, I'm very eclectic so every week my sports schedule changes :P
