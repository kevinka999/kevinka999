# Hello guys, I'm Kevin Katzer :smile:

## Want to know a little about me?
My name is Kevin Katzer, and I'm a Fullstack Web Developer from Brazil!
Actually I'm working most with C# .NET, sometimes Core and sometimes Framework, everything will depends on the moon phase (just kidding).
I'm a frontend lover! Always liked to work with web and lately I'm in love with React.js. Behind the computer, I like to practice some sports, I'm very eclectic, so every week my sports schedule changes :P
